# Steam API .NET

A .NET implementation of the Steam Web API that provides a clean, secure interface for accessing Steam data. This service acts as a proxy to the official Steam Web API, handling authentication and providing a consistent REST interface.

## Features

- üîê **Secure API Key Management** - Server-side Steam API key storage
- üìö **Comprehensive Documentation** - Full Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- üê≥ **Docker Support** - Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- üîÑ **RESTful Interface** - Clean REST endpoints for all Steam API methods
- üìä **Status Monitoring** - Built-in health checks and configuration status
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling** - Robust error handling and logging

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up --build
```

### Option 2: Using Docker directly

```bash
docker build -f docker/steamapi.dockerfile -t steamapi .
docker run -p 5000:80 steamapi
```

### Option 3: Local Development

```bash
cd src/SteamApi
dotnet run
```

## Steam API Key Setup

### Obtaining a Steam API Key
Visit [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) to request an API key. You do not need a valid domain to request an API key.

### Configuration
A Steam API Key should be added using secrets to avoid accidentally committing to a public repository. Refer to [API_KEY_SETUP.md](API_KEY_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## API Documentation

Once running, visit the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5000/swagger` for interactive API documentation.

## API Key Authentication Middleware

This project uses a simple API Key authentication middleware to secure API endpoints.

### How It Works
- All API requests (except `/api/status`, `/api/status/health`, and `/swagger`) require a valid API key.
- The API key must be provided in the `X-API-Key` header (default) or as a `api_key` query parameter.
- Requests without a valid API key will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.
- Rate limiting is enforced per API key (configurable).

### Configuration
- **API keys are NOT stored in source code or committed to Git.**
- API keys are configured via [User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) (for development) or environment variables (for production).
- Example User Secrets setup:
  ```sh
  dotnet user-secrets set "ApiKey:ValidApiKeys:0" "your-dev-key"
  dotnet user-secrets set "ApiKey:ValidApiKeys:1" "another-key"
  ```
- To require API key authentication in development, set `"RequireApiKey": true` in `appsettings.Development.json`.
- Rate limiting and header/query parameter names are configurable in `appsettings.json`.

### Using the API Key
- Add your API key to the `X-API-Key` header in requests:
  ```http
  X-API-Key: your-dev-key
  ```
- Or as a query parameter:
  ```
  GET /api/steamuser/summaries?steamIds=...&api_key=your-dev-key
  ```
- In Swagger UI, use the "Authorize" button and enter your API key.

### Security Best Practices
- **Never commit API keys to source control.**
- Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
- Rotate and revoke API keys as needed.
- For advanced scenarios, integrate with your user management/auth service to generate and manage API keys per user.

## CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configurable via `appsettings.json` to control which domains can access your API.

### Configuration Options
- **Enabled**: Enable/disable CORS globally
- **AllowedOrigins**: List of domains that can access the API
- **AllowedMethods**: HTTP methods allowed (GET, POST, etc.)
- **AllowedHeaders**: Headers that can be sent with requests
- **AllowCredentials**: Whether to allow cookies/authorization headers
- **PreflightMaxAge**: How long to cache preflight requests

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "Cors": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000",
      "https://yourdomain.com"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["Content-Type", "X-API-Key"],
    "AllowCredentials": false
  }
}
```

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: CORS is enabled by default with common localhost origins
- **Production**: CORS is disabled by default - enable and configure specific origins as needed
