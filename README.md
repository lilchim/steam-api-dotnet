# Steam API .NET

A .NET 8 implementation of the Steam Web API that provides a clean, secure interface for accessing Steam data. This service acts as a proxy to the official Steam Web API, handling authentication and providing a consistent REST interface.

## Features

- 🔐 **Secure API Key Management** - Server-side Steam API key storage
- 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation** - Full Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- 🐳 **Docker Support** - Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- 🔄 **RESTful Interface** - Clean REST endpoints for all Steam API methods
- 📊 **Status Monitoring** - Built-in health checks and configuration status
- 🛡️ **Error Handling** - Robust error handling and logging
- 📦 **NuGet Packages** - Reusable models and client libraries

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up --build
```

**Note:** You'll need to set the `STEAM_API_KEY` environment variable or add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Create .env file in docker directory
echo "STEAM_API_KEY=your-steam-api-key" > docker/.env

# Then run
cd docker
docker-compose up --build
```

### Option 2: Using Docker directly

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -f docker/steamapi.dockerfile -t steamapi .

# Run with API key
docker run -p 5000:80 -e "SteamApi__ApiKey=your-steam-api-key" steamapi

# Or pull from Docker Hub
docker pull lilchim/steam-api-dotnet:latest
docker run -p 5000:80 -e "SteamApi__ApiKey=your-steam-api-key" lilchim/steam-api-dotnet:latest
```

### Option 3: Local Development

```bash
cd src/SteamApi
dotnet run
```

## Steam API Key Setup

### Obtaining a Steam API Key
Visit [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) to request an API key. You do not need a valid domain to request an API key.

### Configuration
A Steam API Key should be added using secrets to avoid accidentally committing to a public repository. Refer to [API_KEY_SETUP.md](API_KEY_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## NuGet Packages

### SteamApi.Models
Strongly-typed data transfer objects (DTOs) for Steam Web API responses.

```bash
dotnet add package SteamApi.Models
```

```csharp
using SteamApi.Models.Steam.Player;
using SteamApi.Models.Steam.Responses;

// Use the models in your code
var player = new PlayerSummary
{
    SteamId = 76561198000000000,
    PersonaName = "PlayerName"
};
```

**Features:**
- Player information (profiles, friends, bans, owned games)
- Game information (news, achievements, app lists)
- Response wrappers for all Steam API endpoints
- Full XML documentation and IntelliSense support
- Nullable reference types for proper null handling
- Zero external dependencies for maximum compatibility

See the [SteamApi.Models README](src/SteamApi.Models/README.md) for complete documentation.

### SteamApi.Client
HTTP client library for easy integration with the Steam API service.

```bash
dotnet add package SteamApi.Client
```

```csharp
using SteamApi.Client;
using SteamApi.Client.Extensions;

// Register the client
services.AddSteamApiClient(options =>
{
    options.BaseUrl = "https://your-steam-api.com";
    options.ApiKey = "your-api-key";
});

// Use the client
public class MyService
{
    private readonly ISteamApiClient _steamClient;

    public MyService(ISteamApiClient steamClient)
    {
        _steamClient = steamClient;
    }

    public async Task GetPlayerInfo()
    {
        var playerSummaries = await _steamClient.GetPlayerSummariesAsync("76561198000000000");
        var player = playerSummaries.Response?.Players.FirstOrDefault();
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Player: {player?.PersonaName}");
    }
}
```

**Features:**
- Type-safe API calls with strongly-typed models
- Dependency injection support
- Configurable options (timeouts, logging, etc.)
- Built-in error handling and logging
- Cancellation token support
- Docker container integration

See the [SteamApi.Client README](src/SteamApi.Client/README.md) for complete documentation.

## API Key Authentication Middleware

This project uses a simple API Key authentication middleware to secure API endpoints.

### How It Works
- All API requests (except `/api/status`, `/api/status/health`, and `/swagger`) require a valid API key.
- The API key must be provided in the `X-API-Key` header (default) or as a `api_key` query parameter.
- Requests without a valid API key will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.
- Rate limiting is enforced per API key (configurable).

### Configuration
- **API keys are NOT stored in source code or committed to Git.**
- API keys are configured via [User Secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) (for development) or environment variables (for production).
- Example User Secrets setup:
  ```sh
  dotnet user-secrets set "ApiKey:ValidApiKeys:0" "your-dev-key"
  dotnet user-secrets set "ApiKey:ValidApiKeys:1" "another-key"
  ```
- To require API key authentication in development, set `"RequireApiKey": true` in `appsettings.Development.json`.
- Rate limiting and header/query parameter names are configurable in `appsettings.json`.

### Using the API Key
- Add your API key to the `X-API-Key` header in requests:
  ```http
  X-API-Key: your-dev-key
  ```
- Or as a query parameter:
  ```
  GET /api/steamuser/summaries?steamIds=...&api_key=your-dev-key
  ```
- In Swagger UI, use the "Authorize" button and enter your API key.

### Security Best Practices
- **Never commit API keys to source control.**
- Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
- Rotate and revoke API keys as needed.
- For advanced scenarios, integrate with your user management/auth service to generate and manage API keys per user.

## CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configurable via `appsettings.json` to control which domains can access your API.

### Configuration Options
- **Enabled**: Enable/disable CORS globally
- **AllowedOrigins**: List of domains that can access the API
- **AllowedMethods**: HTTP methods allowed (GET, POST, etc.)
- **AllowedHeaders**: Headers that can be sent with requests
- **AllowCredentials**: Whether to allow cookies/authorization headers
- **PreflightMaxAge**: How long to cache preflight requests

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "Cors": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "http://localhost:3000",
      "https://yourdomain.com"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["Content-Type", "X-API-Key"],
    "AllowCredentials": false
  }
}
```

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: CORS is enabled by default with common localhost origins
- **Production**: CORS is disabled by default - enable and configure specific origins as needed
